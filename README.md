How to run the `hello_pi` demo programs on Raspbian

![](./images/cover.jpg "Raspberry Pi")

##So you’ve got a Raspberry Pi. Now what?

How about running some demo programs that showcase what the Pi is capable of, like awesome high-definition graphics? Raspbian comes with a range of demo programs which you can just compile and run. They range from simple 'hello world' text output, to full 1080p HD video playback, 3D spinning teapots, and real-time animating fractal patterns. These are a fun way to get a feel for what the Pi can do, and to gain some familiarity with navigating around the system and running programs at the command line.

##Time required

* 10 minutes

## Step 1: Setting up your Pi

First check that you have all the parts you need to get your Raspberry Pi set up and working.

- Raspberry Pi
- Micro USB power adaptor
- An SD card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- HDMI cable
- A monitor or TV

###Activity checklist:

1.	Place the SD card into the slot of your Raspberry Pi. It will only fit one way, so be careful not to break the card. 
2.	Next connect the HDMI cable from the monitor (or TV) to the HDMI port on the Pi and turn on your monitor. 
3.	Plug a USB keyboard and mouse into the USB ports on the Pi.
4.	Plug in the micro USB power supply and you should see some text appear on your screen.
5.	When prompted to login type:

	```
	Login: pi
	Password: raspberry
	```

##Step 2: Oh no, a command line interface!

You will find yourself at the prompt below. If you have configured your Pi to automatically go into the desktop interface, use the `start` button to log out of the desktop.

`pi@raspberrypi ~ $ _`

This is the command prompt. It looks difficult to use, but try not to be afraid of it! A CLI or command line interface is actually a very quick and efficient way to use a computer.

To start, navigate to the `hello_pi` folder where all the demos are stored. Enter the command below to do this. **TIP**: You can use the `TAB` key for auto-complete as you enter commands.

`cd /opt/vc/src/hello_pi`

The command prompt should now look like the text below. The blue part shows where you are in the file system of the Pi.

`pi@raspberrypi /opt/vc/src/hello_pi $ _`

If you enter `ls` and press `enter`, you’ll see a list of folders; there is one for each demo. Before you can run them, though, they must be compiled. Don’t worry if you don’t understand what this is or why you need to do it; just follow the instructions for now, and we'll learn more about it later on.

There is a small shell script supplied in the `hello_pi` folder called rebuild.sh which will do the compiling for you. Enter the following command to run it; ignore the gobbledygook for now!

`./rebuild.sh`

A lot of text will scroll up the screen now, but for this exercise you can ignore it. It is just the output of the compiler as it works through the demo code. Wait for the command prompt to return before you continue.

Now we’re finally ready to run some demos!

##Step 3: Hello world

First, let's do a quick test that will ensure the previous compilation step worked correctly. This rather boring program will only display the text `Hello world!` but if it works correctly then we know all the other demos should work too, and we can make more interesting programs run.

Enter the following commands to go inside the `hello_world` folder and list the files:

```
cd hello_world
ls
```

You’ll notice the `.bin` file is shown in green; this is because it is an executable file. This means that it is the file we run to launch the program.

Use the following command to run the demo. You need the `./` to specify the current directory; otherwise the Linux system folders will be searched for the filename you type.

`./hello_world.bin`

##Step 4: Hello video

This will play a 15 second long full HD 1080p video clip with no sound. The intention here is to demonstrate video decode and playback capability. You’ll see that the video is very smooth!

Enter the following commands to navigate to the `hello_video` folder and list the files:

```
cd ..
cd hello_video
ls
```

You’ll notice the `.bin` file again. This demo needs to be told what video clip to play when we run it, though, so this must be the `test.h264` file (h264 is a type of video codec).

You'll need the `./` to specify the current directory again:

`./hello_video.bin test.h264`

You should now see the video clip play. It is taken from the open-source film [Big Buck Bunny] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Buck_Bunny).

##Step 5: Hello triangle

This displays a spinning cube with different images on each side. This is intended to demonstrate OpenGL ES rendering. OpenGL is an open-source programming library for working with 3D graphics.

Enter the following commands to navigate to the `hello_triangle` folder and list its contents:

```
cd ..
cd hello_triangle
ls
```

You’ll see again that one of the files is green; this is the executable file as before. This demo doesn’t need any video input files like the previous one, so you can just go ahead and run the `.bin` file:

`./hello_triangle.bin`

The demo will run forever until you decide to quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl – C`.

##Step 6: Hello triangle 2

This one displays two superimposed fractals, one on top of the other. You can move the mouse to change the shape of the fractal in real time. This is also intended to demonstrate OpenGL ES rendering. Some of you may recognise that this is the [Mandelbrot fractal] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

![](./images/mandelbrot.jpg "Big Buck Bunny")

```
cd ..
cd hello_triangle2
ls
```

Notice the green `.bin` file? OK, run it!

`./hello_triangle2.bin`

Now move the mouse around, and you’ll see the fractal changing. See if you can get it to form a perfect circle; it’s a little tricky, but it can be done. To exit the demo press `Ctrl – C`.

##Step 7: Hello teapot

This displays a spinning teapot with the video clip from `hello_video` texture-mapped onto its surface. It's pretty impressive! You may recognise the teapot model if you’re familiar with a piece of software called [Blender] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)). This demonstrates OpenGL ES rendering and video decoding/playback at the same time.

![](./images/teapot.jpg "Tea Pot")

```
cd ..
cd hello_teapot
ls
```

Notice the green `.bin` file? OK, run it!

`./hello_teapot.bin`

You may receive the following error when you try to run this demo:  

```
Note: ensure you have sufficient gpu_mem configured
eglCreateImageKHR:  failed to create image for buffer 0x1 target 12465 error 0x300c
eglCreateImageKHR failed.
```

Don’t worry though; if you see this error, you just need to alter one configuration setting to make it work.  

The error means the GPU (graphics processing unit) does not have enough memory to run the demo. It’s the GPU that does all the heavy lifting when drawing 3D graphics to the screen, a bit like the graphics card in a gaming PC. The Raspberry Pi shares its memory/RAM between the CPU and GPU, and by default is configured to only give 64 MB of RAM to the GPU. If we increase this to 128 MB that should fix the problem.

To do that, you'll need to enter the following command:

`sudo raspi-config`

This will open up a menu on a blue background. Perform the following actions:

* Go to Advanced Options.
* Go to Memory Split.
* Delete `64` and enter `128` instead. Press `enter`.
* Go down to Finish.
* Click Yes to reboot.

After you have logged back in, enter the following command to get back to the `hello_teapot` demo:

`cd /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/hello_teapot`

Now try and run it again, and you should find it will work.

`./hello_teapot.bin`

The demo will run forever until you quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl – C`. 

##Step 8: Hello audio

This demo just demonstrates audio output. It plays a sine wave, which makes a kind of 'WOO WOO WOO' sound.

```
cd ..
cd hello_audio
ls
```

Notice the green `.bin` file? Run it. Are you getting the hang of this now?

`./hello_audio.bin`

This will play the sound over the headphone jack on the Pi. If you’re using a HDMI monitor you can make it output over HDMI by adding a `1` to the command:

`./hello_audio.bin 1`

The demo will run forever until you quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl – C`.

##Step 9: Other demos

By now you should be getting the hang of navigating up into the parent `hello_pi` folder (using `cd ..`) and then down into one of the demo folders (using `cd hello_something`). Why not try some of the other demos on your own? The `hello_videocube` one is a good place to start.

Good luck!
