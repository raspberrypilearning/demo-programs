## Demo Programs

Raspbian comes with a range of demo programs which you can just compile and run. They range from simple *hello world* text output, to full 1080p HD video playback, 3D spinning teapots and real-time animating fractal patterns. These are a great way to get a feel for what the Pi can do, and to gain some familiarity with navigating around the system and running programs at the command line.
