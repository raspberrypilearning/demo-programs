## Hello audio

This demo just demonstrates audio output. It plays a sine wave, which makes a kind of WOO WOO WOO sound.

```
cd ..
cd hello_audio
ls
```

Notice the green `.bin` file? Run it. Getting the hang of this now?

`./hello_audio.bin`

This will play the sound over the headphone jack on the Pi. If you’re using a HDMI monitor, you can make it output over HDMI by adding a `1` to the command.

`./hello_audio.bin 1`

The demo will run forever until you quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl – C`.
