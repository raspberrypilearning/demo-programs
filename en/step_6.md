## Hello video

This will play a 15 second long, full HD 1080p video clip with no sound. The intention here is to demonstrate video decode and playback capability. You’ll see that it's very smooth!

Enter the following commands to navigate to the `hello_video` folder and list the files.

```
cd ..
cd hello_video
ls
```

You’ll notice the `.bin` file again. This demo needs to be told what video clip to play when we run it though, so this must be the `test.h264` file (h264 is a type of video codec).

You'll need the `./` to specify the current directory again.

`./hello_video.bin test.h264`
