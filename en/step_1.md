## What you will make
How about running some demo programs that showcase what the Pi is capable of?  Awesome graphics, anyone?

Raspbian comes with a range of demo programs which you can just compile and run.  They range from simple *hello world* text output, to full 1080p HD video playback, 3D spinning teapots and real-time animating fractal patterns.
These are a great way to get a feel for what the Pi can do, and to gain some familiarity with navigating around the system and running programs at the command line.
